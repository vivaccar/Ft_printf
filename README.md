# Ft_printf
This project aims to recreate the printf function in C, one of the most fundamental functions in the language. In tackling this task, we will seek to deepen our understanding of string manipulation, dynamic memory allocation, and advanced use of pointers.

## Allowed functions
malloc, free 
write
va_start, va_arg, va_copy, va_end

## Skills
### String Manipulation in C:
When recreating the printf function, you will need to handle formatted strings by interpreting format characters (%d, %i, %c %s, %p, %h, %H) and replacing them with the corresponding values. This involves careful manipulation of strings in C, including copying, concatenation, and appropriate formatting.

### Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation:
The printf function needs to deal with arguments of various types. This requires the use of pointers to access values passed as arguments. Additionally, you may need to dynamically allocate memory to temporarily store formatted strings before printing them.

### Varargs and Macros in C:
The printf function accepts a variable number of arguments (varargs). This involves the use of macros and handling the mechanism of passing variable arguments in C (such as va_list, va_start, va_arg, and va_end).

### String Analysis and Type Conversion:
To interpret format characters, you need to develop robust logic to analyze the format string and identify corresponding data types. This may include implementing type conversions to ensure that arguments are printed correctly.

### Deep Understanding of the Internal Operation of Printf:
Recreating the printf function requires a profound knowledge of how string formatting functions internally operate. This includes understanding the workings of the format specifier system, handling width and precision, and dealing with special flags.
